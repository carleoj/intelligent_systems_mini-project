# Intelligent Systems Mini-Project

A machine learning mini-project developed for the course **CS 003 – Intelligent Systems**.  
This repository contains an experimental study that evaluates boosting-based classification models on stress-related questionnaire data.

## Overview
This project explores how different boosting algorithms perform on a dataset derived from the Stress subscale of a psychological questionnaire.  
All implementation, experimentation, and evaluation are contained within a single Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents
- **DASS Boosting.ipynb** – main notebook for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter search, and evaluation  
- Supporting Python and ML libraries (imported inside the notebook)

## Built With
- Python  
- pandas, numpy – data handling  
- scikit-learn – machine learning models  
- Jupyter Notebook – experiment environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter

### Running the Notebook

## Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/carleoj/intelligent_systems_mini-project.git

## Navigate to the project folder and launch Jupyter:
cd intelligent_systems_mini-project
jupyter notebook

### Open DASS Boosting.ipynb and run all cells to reproduce the experiment.
